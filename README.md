# Setup and run
Trickshot IO up until version 0.6 was made using Unity 2020.1.17f1 which is deprecated/not available in Gnome Linux,Because of version differences while trying to work on the game we encountered compilation errors trying to import the game in our new Unity enviroment.


## Fix?
Download the latest version of Unity I'm using(2021.2.2f1).

- Using unityHub open the project you will be presented with splash menu asking if you want to "Enter safe mode" click the ignore button.

- After successfully opening our project go to Our Package manager and re-import all the files that make up our Project that should fix some of our errors.
- I encountered a duplication problem.Most of our  scripts were duplicated which caused compilation errors to fix this just delete the copies, that should remove some of our errors.
- We also discovered that most of our game objects Sprites(images) were automatically removed which forced us to re-apply them one by one just to restore our scenes back to normal its a lot of work but you have to do it if you have the same problem.
- Also our game object scripts were also removed from their game objects,im guessing its because of the Unity version differences.To make it work you are going to have to re- apply them .I think you can figure out which script belongs to which game object just by exploring the files and folders I believe in you you've got this.

- That's all the problems we faced while working on our game update if you are still getting errors you can hit me up I will gladly help.


## Walkaround 

- If you are a Windows/Mac OS user you can find the Unity 2020.1.17f1 Download on their website .You are so lucky wish i could be you.
